# VBVU
A quick and dirty VB program to interface with the STM32 VU-meter

Reads the peak audio value of a process in real time and transmits it via RS232
to a microcontroller.

This program requires [cscore.dll](https://github.com/filoe/cscore) by [Florian Rosmann](https://github.com/filoe)

*Please note* : This project will likely not be updated for very long, I'm planning to rewrite a better cross-platform version in C++ as soon as I can
